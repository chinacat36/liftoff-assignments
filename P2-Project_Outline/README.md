# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will be creating a website for a fitness nutritionist.  
Without a website, her clients contact her constantly 
for meal plans and recipes that she provides for them. 
This becomes redundant and is not "DRY" as we would say! 
With a website, her clients will be able to have
all of her recipes in one place, create their 
weekly menus, and track their progress.  New clients 
will be able to look at the about page to learn more about 
her program and view various testimonials. This will 
save her a lot of time to hopefully grow her business
and direct her focus elsewhere. I believe the clients 
will also enjoy having their own user profile to view 
instead of having to contact her all the time.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log 
in to the application. Each user will have a profile page and 
list of recipes to choose from.

Search: Users will be able to search for recipes containing
given text.

Create Menu: Users will be able to choose recipes for the week 
and display their weekly menu once choosen. 

Create Post: Users will be able to create new blog posts when 
logged in. Blog posts will track meal plans and how they are 
feeling. New posts will appear in the userâ€™s profile.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
There are a few learning curves here! I will have to learn...
1) How to fetch data from a file source to 
view the recipes as well as the testimonials.  
2) How to apply Angular into IntelliJ. 
3) How to apply OAuth for user login authorization. 

My client is wanting to add re-occurring paypal payments through
the website, but I do not think that is possible?
