# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will be creating a website for a nutritionist. Currently, she has
no online presence.  When approached by a new client, she will be able to direct them to her website. There,
they can view more information about her program as well as see
past clients that have had success. The user will be able to fill
out a personal form to request more information from her and become
a potential new client.  I would also like to implement special
menus clients can purchase if they do not prefer to go the 
personalized menu route. This will save her a lot of time and help
grow her business. 

### Features
New Client Form: Request more information for personalized menus 
based on age, height, weight, medical history, activity level. 

View of testimonials: A page about her business with pictures of
clients that have had success. 

Special Menus to Purchase: If clients are not interested in having 
a personalized menu made for them, there will be pre-made menus to 
purchase.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
There are a few learning curves here! I will have to learn...
1) How to fetch data from a file source to 
view the testimonials.  
2) How to apply Angular into IntelliJ. 
3) How to apply OAuth for user login authorization. 
4) How to add a purchasing feature for pre-made menus.
